		Hi, my name is Francisco. I'm currently working as a software developer at a company called IBT developing the PowerMarketing platform for the Realtime Web.

		I studied Computer Engineering at ISEL (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa) and I've been working on the wild for the past 3 years. By virtue of my school, teachers and friends I believe I have a strong foundation in software development. I've mainly worked with Microsoft technologies and consider myself reasonably experienced in them. I'm not afraid to dabble with anything I'm not familiar with and I've developed some Java and C aplications in previous jobs.
		</p>
		<p>
		On my free time I try to explore the ever increasing ecosystem of software development tools and technologies. Recently I've been experimenting more with javascript frameworks and apis.

		When I'm not sitting at my computer I'm busy dedicating time to one of my many interests.
