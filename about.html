			I studied Computer Engineering at ISEL (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa) and I've been working in the wild for the past 4 years. Due to my academic and professional background I've developed a strong foundation in software development. I've mainly worked with Microsoft technologies and consider myself reasonably experienced in them. I'm not afraid to dabble with anything I'm not familiar with and I've developed some Java and C aplications in previous jobs.

			On my free time I like to explore the ever increasing ecosystem of software development tools and technologies.Recently I've been experimenting more with javascript frameworks and apis.

			Besides developing software I like to play and collect video games, watch a lot of movies and play board games with friends. An occasional drink in cool bars doesn't hurt either.
